This design pattern helps in segreegating client from product by using factory class (abstract class)

The basic idea is client need not know the internal crration of prodicts yet able to create the type of product as needed.
Injecting a factory as an abstract over the product helps in decoupling client and product.

So from client point of view we need only pass the product type to the factory and get the end product.
This helps in reducing the effect on client whenever any changes are done to the product side, 

All the logoc for selection of product is abstarcted from client and taken care by factory.

For code refer to Code - Factory Design

two vechicle classes (car and bike has been inherited from base class vehicle) 
A factory class acts as intermediary between the client and product (vehicle) for abstarcting product creation.
